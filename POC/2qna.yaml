      transmitting the required Transaction data in an online Financial Advice/0220 message or as
      part of a batch notification.

      (Response Code) of the Authorization Request Response/0110 or Financial Transaction Request
      Response/0210 message. If a Mastercard or Debit Mastercard Account is open and active, the
      Issuer must provide a value of 00 (Approved) or 85 (Not Declined) in DE 39.
      
      Mastercard will deem an Issuer to be noncompliant with this requirement if the Issuer declines

      decline, approves a Transaction authorization request for a non-zero Transaction amount
      involving the same Merchant or Sponsored Merchant and the same Account. A noncompliant
