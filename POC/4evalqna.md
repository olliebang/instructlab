Q: When did this guidance on client identification come into effect?
A: The guidance came into effect on June 1, 2021.

Q: What is the minimum amount that triggers identity verification for a large cash transaction?
A: Identity verification is required for cash transactions of $10,000 or more.

Q: What is the threshold amount for verifying identity in international electronic funds transfers (EFT)?
A: Identity verification is required for international EFTs of $1,000 or more.

Q: How does the "24-hour rule" apply to virtual currency transactions?
A: The 24-hour rule applies to virtual currency transactions equivalent to $10,000 or more, meaning transactions within a 24-hour period must be considered together when determining if the threshold is met.

Q: In what situation would a financial entity NOT need to verify the identity of someone conducting a suspicious transaction?
A: A financial entity doesn't need to verify identity if:
- They have already verified the person's identity and have no doubts about the identification information, or
- They believe that verifying identity would tip off the person that a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is being submitted.

Q: What are the verification requirements for credit card accounts with multiple cardholders?
A: The financial entity must verify the identity of all co-applicants (account holders) before the credit card can be activated, but does not need to verify the identity of additional cardholders who are not account holders, even if they are authorized to give instructions.

Q: How do the client identification requirements differ between traditional currency exchange and virtual currency exchange?
A: Traditional currency exchange requires identity verification for transactions of $3,000 or more, while virtual currency exchange requires verification for transactions equivalent to $1,000 or more. This indicates a more stringent approach to virtual currency transactions.

Q: What is the regulatory approach to group plan accounts, and how does it balance risk management with practical considerations?
A: The approach shows a risk-based balance by:
- Not requiring verification of individual members if the plan sponsor's identity has been verified
- Exempting verification when contributions come from the sponsor or payroll deduction
- Still requiring verification of individuals authorized to give instructions in certain cases
This suggests a focus on the entity presenting the primary risk (the sponsor) while recognizing the lower risk of individual employees.

Q: How does the guidance address the challenge of ongoing monitoring versus re-identification?
A: The guidance makes a clear distinction:
- Ongoing monitoring requires keeping client identification information up to date based on risk assessment
- This doesn't require re-identification using formal verification methods
- Updates focus on basic information like name, address, occupation, or nature of business
- The frequency is determined by the institution's risk assessment and policies

Q: A trust company is managing an inter vivos trust. Who must they verify the identity of?
A: The trust company must verify the identity of:
- Every person who is the settlor of the inter vivos trust
- Any person authorized to act as co-trustee
- If an entity is a co-trustee, the identity of the entity and up to three persons authorized to give instructions on its behalf

Q: In what situations would a financial entity be exempt from verifying identity for a business account?
A: Exemptions apply for:
- Public bodies
- Very large corporations or trusts
- Subsidiaries of these entities (if their financial statements are consolidated with the parent)
- When opening subsequent accounts for existing account holders
- When at least three authorized persons on the account have already been verified

Q: What are the identification requirements for prepaid payment product (PPP) accounts?
A: PPP accounts require verification of:

Q: How does the guidance handle virtual currency transactions related to blockchain validation?
A: Identity verification is not required when transferring or receiving virtual currency:
- As compensation for validating transactions recorded in a distributed ledger
- For nominal amounts used solely to validate another transaction
- For transfers of information

Q: What special considerations exist for mutual fund accounts regarding client identification?
A: Identity verification isn't required for mutual fund accounts if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a securities dealer has already verified the client's identity in accordance with Regulations, either for:
- The specific mutual fund sale, or
- A transaction that is part of a series including that sale

Q: If a financial entity receives multiple virtual currency transactions from the same person throughout a day, how should they apply the large transaction rules?
A: They should aggregate all virtual currency transactions from that person within the 24-hour period. If the combined equivalent value reaches or exceeds $10,000, they must verify the person's identity, as this falls under the 24-hour rule for large virtual currency transactions.

Q: In what cases would a financial entity need to verify identity for both the sender and receiver of a transaction?
A: This would occur in cases involving international electronic funds transfers or virtual currency transfers of $1,000 or more where the financial entity:
- Initiates the transfer for the sender AND
- Remits the funds/VC to the beneficiary
They would need to verify both parties' identities as these are separate triggering events under the regulations.

Q: What are the key differences in verification requirements between regular credit card accounts and prepaid payment product (PPP) accounts?
A: The key differences are:
- Credit cards: Only account holders need verification before activation; additional cardholders don't need verification even if authorized to give instructions
- PPP accounts: Require verification of both account holders (before activation) AND all authorized users (before first transaction), plus anyone making payments of $1,000 or more to the account

Q: How do the requirements handle death benefit deposits from life insurance policies?
A: Identity verification is not required when:
- The account is opened at an entity's request for a life insurance company's death benefit deposit
- The account is in the name of a person beneficiary
- Only the death benefit can be deposited
- The policy/annuity was in existence for at least two years before the claim

Q: What scenarios require "reasonable measures" to verify identity rather than mandatory verification?
A: The main scenario is suspicious transactions, where financial entities must take "reasonable measures" to verify identity before submitting a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR), unless:
- Identity was previously verified with no doubts
- Verification might tip off the person about the STR

Q: How does the guidance address the verification requirements for business accounts with multiple authorized persons?
A: For business accounts:
- The financial entity must verify at least three persons authorized to give instructions
- If one of the three identified persons leaves, another authorized person must be verified
- Once three people are verified, additional authorized persons don't need verification
- The identity of the business entity itself must still be verified

  - Similar provincial legislation
- The opening of:
  - A registered plan account
  - A locked-in retirement plan account

A: Identity verification is not required for:
- Accounts established under Canadian securities regulator escrow requirements
- Accounts required by Canadian stock exchange rules

This exemption recognizes the existing regulatory oversight of these accounts.

Q: What are the key considerations for keeping client identification information current?
A: Financial entities must:
- Update client information based on their risk assessment
- Follow their established policies and procedures for update frequency
- Focus on basic information (name, address, occupation, business nature)
- Not necessarily re-verify identity using formal methods
- Maintain ongoing monitoring of business relationships

Q: Scenario - Multiple Cash Deposits
Q: A customer makes three cash deposits at different branch locations on the same day:
- Morning: $4,000
- Afternoon: $3,500
- Evening: $3,000
Do we need to verify their identity?
A: Yes, identity verification is required. Although each individual transaction is under $10,000, the combined total of $10,500 within a 24-hour period exceeds the $10,000 threshold. The 24-hour rule requires aggregating multiple cash transactions from the same person or entity within a 24-hour period.

Q: Scenario - Family Credit Card Account
Q: A parent is opening a credit card account and wants to add their spouse as a joint account holder and get additional cards for their two teenage children. Who needs identity verification?
A: In this scenario:
- Both the parent and spouse need identity verification as they are co-applicants/account holders
- The teenage children do not need identity verification, even though they will have cards, because they are not account holders
The account cannot be activated until both adult co-applicants' identities are verified.

Q: Scenario - Business Account Setup
Q: A small business is opening an account with five authorized signers. The business is incorporated and has been operating for three years. What are the verification requirements?
A: The requirements are:
- Verify the identity of the corporation itself
- Verify the identity of at least three of the five authorized signers before the first transaction
- Keep records of all five authorized signers
- If any of the three verified signers leaves, verify the identity of another signer to maintain at least three verified individuals

Q29: Scenario - Virtual Currency Trading
Q: A customer conducts the following virtual currency transactions in one day:
- 10:00 AM: Sells Bitcoin equivalent to $800
- 2:00 PM: Buys Ethereum equivalent to $500
- 4:00 PM: Exchanges different virtual currencies equivalent to $1,200
What verification is required?
A: The financial entity must:
- Verify identity for the $1,200 virtual currency exchange as it exceeds the $1,000 threshold for VC exchange transactions
- The other two transactions require identity verification if they are exchange transactions (VC to funds or vice versa) as they exceed $1,000
- If these are simply transfers, only the $1,200 transaction requires verification
- The 24-hour rule doesn't apply here as each transaction is evaluated separately against the $1,000 threshold for VC transactions

Q: Scenario - International Transfer
Q: A customer without an account wants to send an international wire transfer of $950 and then returns two hours later to send another international transfer of $200. What are the verification requirements?
A: The financial entity must verify the customer's identity for EACH international EFT of $1,000 or more when the transaction is being requested. In this scenario:
- First transfer: $950 - No verification required as it's below $1,000
- Second transfer: $200 - No verification required as it's below $1,000
The document does not indicate that these amounts should be aggregated for international EFTs. The 24-hour rule is specifically mentioned only for large cash transactions and large virtual currency transactions. Each international EFT is evaluated independently against the $1,000 threshold.

Q: Scenario - Trust Account Opening
Q: A trust company is opening a trust account where:
- There are two settlors
- Three co-trustees (one is a corporation)
- The corporation has four authorized signers
Who needs to be verified?
A: The trust company must verify:
- Both settlors' identities
- The identities of all three co-trustees
- For the corporate co-trustee:
  - The corporation's identity
  - The identity of up to three persons authorized to give instructions on behalf of the corporation
  - If more than three people are authorized, only three need to be verified

Q: Scenario - Prepaid Product Account
Q: A parent wants to open a prepaid payment product account for their college student with the following details:
- Parent will be the account holder
- Student will be an authorized user
- Parent plans to load $1,500 initially
- Grandparent wants ability to load funds
What are the verification requirements?

- Verify the parent's identity (account holder) before activating the account
- Verify the student's identity (authorized user) before their first transaction
- Verify the grandparent's identity when they make any load of $1,000 or more
- Verify the parent's identity for the initial $1,500 load as it exceeds $1,000

Q: Scenario - Account Opening at Different Branches
Q: A customer opens a checking account at one branch, then visits another branch the next week to open a savings account. Do they need to verify their identity again?
A: No, identity verification is not required for the savings account because:
- The person already has an account with the financial entity
- The exemption for subsequent accounts applies
- However, the financial entity should confirm they have proper records of the previous verification and no doubts about the identification information
