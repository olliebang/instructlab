This involves: a) conducting a visual inspection of government-issued photo identification documents such as passports or driver's licences to ensure they are authentic, valid and current; b) using technology to assess the authenticity of digital copies of the government-issued photo identification documents, e.g., scanned images; c) verifying the person’s residential address by comparing it with an address listed on a credit report or utility bill; d) cross-checking information such as the person’s name and address against other databases, e.g., social security numbers, date of birth or account type to ensure consistency; e) conducting additional due diligence as required by the specific situation or jurisdiction, such as requiring in-person visits for high risk accounts."}

For example, if a person has an ongoing business relationship with the RE, such as regularly making deposits into a bank account held at the RE, the RE could use that ongoing relationship to help establish the person’s identity.

Please provide a brief description and any relevant examples for each method.", "assistant": "The three methods that can be used for verifying the identity of a person in Canada are:\n1. The government-issued photo identification method: This involves checking a document, such as a passport or driver's license, to confirm a person’s name and photograph match. For example, when Jane Smith opens a bank account with you, her name and appearance match the name and photograph on her valid driver’s licence, so the government-issued photo identification method can be used for verifying her identity.\n2. The credit file method: This involves checking information in a credit file to verify a person's identity. For example, when Jane Smith applies for a loan with you, you check her credit file and find that it matches information she provided about herself, so the credit file method can be used for verifying her identity.\n3. The dual-process method: This involves using both the government-issued photo identification method and the credit file method to verify a person's identity. For example, when Jane Smith applies for a mortgage with you, you use both her driver’s licence and her credit file to verify her identity, so the dual-process method can be used for verifying her identity.\n\nFor each method, the document should provide information on what it involves, how it works, and any examples of when it is used."}

This approach allows FINTRAC to focus its resources on high-risk situations while also ensuring that all reporting entities are meeting their obligations.\n\nThe risk-based approach works as follows:\n1. Identify potential risks: FINTRAC identifies potential money laundering risks based on factors such as the individual’s or entity’s profile and circumstances, as well as any suspicious activities or transactions.\n2. Assess risks: FINTRAC assesses the level of risk associated with each identified situation. This assessment takes into account various factors, including the nature of the activity or transaction, the parties involved, and the amount of money being handled.\n3. Mitigate risks: Based on the risk assessment, FINTRAC requires reporting entities to take appropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks. These measures can include increased due diligence, enhanced customer identification procedures, or stricter monitoring of certain transactions.\n4. Monitor and review: FINTRAC monitors the effectiveness of these measures and reviews them regularly to ensure they remain up-to-date and effective in addressing current money laundering risks."}

These tradelines typically come from various financial institutions such as banks, credit card companies, utility service providers, etc. The credit bureau then consolidates this information into a single report or file, making it easier for entities like REs to access and utilize the data when verifying a person's identity. By serving as an aggregator, the credit bureau facilitates the collection of diverse and comprehensive data from various sources, streamlining the verification process."}
