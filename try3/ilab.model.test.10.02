 user prompt: When using the credit file method to verify the identity of a person, what are
the requirements for the credit file?

### 2.2 Credit file method
You may verify the identity of a person by referring to information that is in their credit file.
To do so, the credit file must:
- contain information that is valid and current;
- be from a Canadian credit bureau (credit files from foreign credit bureaus are not acceptable);
- have been in existence for at least three years;
- contain information that is derived from more than one source (i.e. more than one tradeline); and
- match the name, address and date of birth of the person being identified.

A credit file provides a rating on a person's ability to repay loans; however, it is possible to
request a credit file to verify a person's identifying information that does not include a credit
assessment. You do not need a credit assessment to verify the identity of a person.
Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada are Canadian credit bureaus that provide credit file
information for identification purposes.

To use the credit file method, you must conduct the search at the time you are verifying the person's identity.
A person cannot provide you with a copy of their credit file, nor can a previously obtained credit file be used.

It is acceptable to use an automated system to match the person's information with the
information in the person's credit file. You may also refer to a third party vendor
to provide you with valid and current information from the person's credit file.
A third party vendor is a business that is authorized by a Canadian credit bureau
to provide access to Canadian credit information.


#### Record keeping requirements for the credit file method
If you use the credit file method, you must record:
- the person's name;
- the date you consulted or searched the credit file;
- the name of the Canadian credit bureau or third party vendor as the source holding the credit file; and
- the person's credit file number.
expected output: When using the credit file method to verify the identify of a person,

 user prompt: When using the credit file method to verify the identity of a person, how many years
must the credit file have been in existence?

### 2.2 Credit file method
You may verify the identity of a person by referring to information that is in their credit file.
To do so, the credit file must:
- contain information that is valid and current;
- be from a Canadian credit bureau (credit files from foreign credit bureaus are not acceptable);
- have been in existence for at least three years;
- contain information that is derived from more than one source (i.e. more than one tradeline); and
- match the name, address and date of birth of the person being identified.

A credit file provides a rating on a person's ability to repay loans; however, it is possible to
request a credit file to verify a person's identifying information that does not include a credit
assessment. You do not need a credit assessment to verify the identity of a person.
Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada are Canadian credit bureaus that provide credit file
information for identification purposes.

To use the credit file method, you must conduct the search at the time you are verifying the person's identity.
A person cannot provide you with a copy of their credit file, nor can a previously obtained credit file be used.

It is acceptable to use an automated system to match the person's information with the
information in the person's credit file. You may also refer to a third party vendor
to provide you with valid and current information from the person's credit file.

- the person's name;
- the date you consulted or searched the credit file;
- the name of the Canadian credit bureau or third party vendor as the source holding the credit file; and
- the person's credit file number.
expected output: At least 3 years.

The credit file method requires that the credit file being used for identification purposes must be from a Canadian credit bureau, as stated in the provided text. Credit files from foreign credit bureaus are not acceptable for this purpose. This is because the government does not recognize foreign credit bureaus, making their information unreliable or unlikely to match an individual's Canadian

If a child is under 12 years of age, you must verify the identity of one parent, guardian or tutor
and record the parent, guardian or tutor's information.You can rely on the information provided by the
parent, guardian or tutor in order to record the child's identification details.

If a child is between 12 and 15 years of age, you can verify their identity by using any of
the methods. If this is not possible due to a lack of identification information, you may

- Refer to one reliable source of information that includes the name and address of the
  child's parent, guardian, or tutor;and
- Refer to a second reliable source that includes the child's name and date of birth.

For example, if the child has a passport you may be able to use it to verify their identity under
the government-issued photo identification method.  If not, you could rely on the parent's driver's
licence to verify the parent's name and their common address, and the child's birth certificate
to verify the child's name and date of birth.
