      ### 2.2 Credit file method
      You may verify the identity of a person by referring to information that is in their credit file.
      To do so, the credit file must:
      - contain information that is valid and current;
      - be from a Canadian credit bureau (credit files from foreign credit bureaus are not acceptable);
      - have been in existence for at least three years;
      - contain information that is derived from more than one source (i.e. more than one tradeline); and
      - match the name, address and date of birth of the person being identified.

      A credit file provides a rating on a person's ability to repay loans; however, it is possible to
      request a credit file to verify a person's identifying information that does not include a credit
      assessment. You do not need a credit assessment to verify the identity of a person.
      Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada are Canadian credit bureaus that provide credit file
      information for identification purposes.

      To use the credit file method, you must conduct the search at the time you are verifying the person's identity.
      A person cannot provide you with a copy of their credit file, nor can a previously obtained credit file be used.

      It is acceptable to use an automated system to match the person's information with the
      information in the person's credit file. You may also refer to a third party vendor
      to provide you with valid and current information from the person's credit file.
      A third party vendor is a business that is authorized by a Canadian credit bureau
      to provide access to Canadian credit information.


      #### Record keeping requirements for the credit file method
      If you use the credit file method, you must record:
      - the person's name;
      - the date you consulted or searched the credit file;
      - the name of the Canadian credit bureau or third party vendor as the source holding the credit file; and
      - the person's credit file number.

      and record the parent, guardian or tutor's information.You can rely on the information provided by the
      parent, guardian or tutor in order to record the child's identification details.

      the methods. If this is not possible due to a lack of identification information, you may
      se a variation of the dual-process method that allows you to:
      - Refer to one reliable source of information that includes the name and address of the
        child's parent, guardian, or tutor;and
      - Refer to a second reliable source that includes the child's name and date of birth.

      For example, if the child has a passport you may be able to use it to verify their identity under
      the government-issued photo identification method.  If not, you could rely on the parent's driver's
      licence to verify the parent's name and their common address, and the child's birth certificate
      to verify the child's name and date of birth.
