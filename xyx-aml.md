XYZ Corp AML, Anti-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Measures Program

XYZ Corp Definitions
XYZ Corp's AML Program is a company-wide system of principles and procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and risk parameters respecting Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions measures.

XYZ Corp's Anti-Money Laundering Reporting Officers ("AMLROs") are individuals appointed by Operating Groups responsible for ensuring their respective lines of business adhere
to the XYZ Corp's AML program 

XYZ Corp's Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer ("CAMLO") is the officer responsible for governance, independent oversight, and assessment of the AML Program as 
further described in this Policy. XYZ Corp's CAMLO reports to the Chief Risk Officer ("CRO")

XYZ Corp's Enterprise AML Program Manual ("Program Manual") is issued by XYZ Corp's CAMLO and outlines the minimum standards and guidelines for each of the Enterprise's 
businesses so that all reasonable measures are implemented to prevent the use of the Enterprise's financial products and services fo the purpose of 
Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing or Sanctioned activity.

Money Laundering ("ML") is any act or attempted act to copceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.

Sanctions Measures ("Sanctions") are enacted by legislation, regulation or other binding instruments and prohibit or restrict dealing with specified groups, 
entities, individuals, governments, countries, regions, services, products or activities.

Terrorist Financing ("TF") is the collection, possession, provision, contribution or solicitation of funds intended to be used carry out or facilitate a terrorist activity
or benefit a torrist or terrorist group.


Operational Elements of XYZ Corp's AML program include Customer Due Diligience ("CDD"); Enhanced Due Diligence ("EDD"); 
Transaction Monitoring and Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reporting; and Sanctions.

CDD is required to identify and verify customer information and establish a reasonable belief to know the true identity of each of its customers, know the types of business 
and transactions the customer is likely to undertake and understand the risks the customer represents. The information obtained through the CDD process assists in 
identifying higher risk customers. Through the identification of its higher risk customer base, XYZ Corp is better able to allocate resources to implement and 
execute a more effective and risk-based monitoring process and strategy for these customers. For some customers, additional due diligence, 
referred to as Enhanced Due Diligence ("EDD"), is required to ensure that XYZ Corp determines the nature and extent of the customer's risk and the 
acceptability of the relationship.

XYZ Corp must collect required information and verify the identify of customers and other prescribed measures in respect of customers, assess the overall 
risk the customer represents and establish appropriate ongoing monitoring requirements or exit the relationship if it exceeds XYZ Corp's AML Program 
risk appetite. If XYZ Corp cannot appropriately verify the identify of customers, it is prohibited from transacting business with such customers.

Transaction Monitoring and Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reporting - XYZ Corp supports the efforts of law enforcement and other agencies to combat ML and TF offences. The reporting of suspicious activity/transactions by financial institutions is critical to a country's ability to utilize financial information to combat ML/TF and other financial crimes.
Transaction monitoring is a critical internal detective control whose purpose is to identify and protect XYZ Corp from transactions that may lead 
to Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing and to identify anomalies and file relevant Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports ("SAR/STRs") 
with the appropriate regulatory authorities.
XYZ Corp must employ transaction monitoring which is designed to identify anomalies in transactional activity that may indicate 
suspicious activity/transactions.
XYZ Corp is required to report an activity/transaction where it has a reasonable ground of suspicion that the activity/transaction (whether completed or merely attempted) relates to a completed or attempted ML or TF offence.

Sanctions - Sanctions serve to further foreign policy objectives and are considered a viable alternative to military intervention to influence 
change in repressive regimes, or those with connections to terrorism, nuclear proliferation, or other threats to international peace and security.
Sanctions seek to prohibit or restrict access to funds or the financial system, trade and the associated financing of specific products or 
with specific parties or jurisdictions, or the provision of financial or related services to, or for the benefit of a country or anyone in that 
country. XYZ Corp respects and complies with the applicable Sanctions of regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which it operates.

Mandatory Reporting and Record Keeping - mandatory reporting  include cash 
transactions, international electronic funds transfers and terrorist property reports to financial intelligence or regulatory agencies 
in order to faciliate investigations and prosecutions of ML and TF offences. 
Records must be kept to facilitate the reconstruction of individual transactions and provide, if necessary, evidence for the 
prosecution of criminal activity. XYZ Corp supports these efforts by providing prescribed reports and keeping records.
XYZ Corp must comply with local legislative requirements regarding reporting customer transaction activity such as cash transactions, 
electronic fund transfers, terrorist property reports and any other applicable transaction activity reports. XYZ Corp must keep all legislatively 
required AML Program records in accordance with the Data & Analytics Risk Directive and for a minimum of five (5) years. Records must be 
held in a reproducible form sufficient to meet any international or local jurisdictional requirements for production.
